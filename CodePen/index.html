  <p align="left"><strong>     Isamu Akasaki</strong> Isamu Akasaki was born in Chiran in the Kagoshima district of Japan. After studying electrical engineering at the University of Kyoto, he began working at the electronics company Kobe Kogyo Corporation. He returned to academia and received his doctorate in 1964 from Nagoya University. After having worked many years at the electronics company Matsuhita, in 1981 he became a professor at Nagoya University and then eventually at Meijo University, also in Nagoya.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Hiroshi Amano</strong> was born in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, on September 11, 1960, to his father Tatsuji and mother Yoshiko, and he grew up with younger brother Takashi. Hamamatsu is famous as the birthplace of Professor Kenjiro Takayanagi, a Japanese pioneer in the development of television, who succeeded in transmitting the first Katakana character “イ” by wireless transfer using a Braun tube in 1926, and also Soichiro Honda, who established Honda Motor Co., Ltd., in 1946. In addition, several engineering and manufacturing companies, such as motorbike companies, musical instrument companies, and optoelectronics companies, are based in Hamamatsu. A possible reason why he considered a career in engineering may have been the influence of growing up in such an industrial city.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Shuji Nakamura</strong> was born on May 22, 1954 in Oku, a tiny fishing village on the Pacific coast of Shikoku, the smallest of Japan’s four main islands. Farming is the principle occupation in Oku. Local farmers grow yams on steps cut into steep hillsides. Shuji’s maternal grandparents owned such a farm. To get to the nearest town, the villagers relied on a ferry. Inconvenient perhaps, but the village was an idyllic place to grow up.</p>
